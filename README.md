# Readers' Club

Learning should be open and fun and only then it can 
add value. To make it fun, the learning envirionment
must be unbiased, collaborative and participative. 
Inorder to create value from learning, such environment 
is as important as the quality of the content. Therefore,
this is my way of learning where everyone is welcome 
to participate. Please do comment kindly, and contribute
as you see fit.


### About The Repository
An open sourced collaborative approach to learning 
using Github as the learning mamangement platform. 
Read with me, @codeanit. 

[Issues](https://github.com/learnwithanit/readersclub.github.io/issues) is the main learning management system. 
The topic are mainly tech related but could be anything 
random.

The nature of issues here are supposed to be long lived
such as books, novels, massive open online courses.

For short daily study I use another account [Today I Learn](https://github.com/codeanit/til/issues)
for learning books and online courses. This is also open
sourced if you would like participate.

If you have anything to ask, please create an [issue](https://github.com/codeanit/ama/issues).

Thank you.
